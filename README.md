# X-ray-Datasets
In this repository, I will gradually upload labeled datasets for X-ray baggage detection for researches in this field.

GDXray-Expanded dataset is an extension of GDXray dataset, there are 10000 grayscale images which include gun, scissors,knives, and several types of explosives. The image background is complex, and there are varying degrees of occlusion and overlap between items, which is more in line with actual security screening scenarios. Two annotation formats are provided: VOC and coco. The classes are grenade-normal, grenade-handle, grenade-rectangle, grenade-tube, scissors, gun and knife.
